## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

-Time Blocks: The planner presents time blocks for standard business hours, allowing users to plan their activities for each hour of the day.

-Local Storage: The application utilizes local storage to save the entered events. When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist, ensuring that users' schedule data is not lost.
